\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to utilize this section to thank the University of Freiburg and ek robotics for the opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge obtained in the course of my Master's, through this thesis. Acknowledging the policy of unrestricted access to cutting-edge research at the Chair of Systems Optimization and Control headed by Prof. Dr. Moritz Diehl, I would like to thank Jonathan Frey for his careful supervision and innovative proposals. A word of thanks is due to Rudolf Reiter for his constructive feedback, Wim Van Roy and several other team members at the department, with whom I could freely brainstorm. The exchange of views with my fellow students, Yizhen Wang, Mohammed Hababeh and Sourish Pramanick often provided new perspectives in the face of stubborn challenges. 
\par At ek robotics, I would like to especially mention the team of Karsten Bohlmann, starting with Kathrin Pregizer and Peter Götz, whose timely ideas for practical constraints went a long way in realizing the experiments. Daniel Klöser who facilitated this collaboration, has been an exemplary advisor whose patience and meticulous direction have been invaluable from ideation to execution. I am also thankful for friends and family whose encouragement kept me motivated and in good cheer, and God almighty for the strength to see this through.
