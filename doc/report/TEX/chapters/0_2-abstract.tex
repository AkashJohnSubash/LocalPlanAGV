\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis proposes an optimal control scheme for an \ac{AGV} at ek robotics GmbH, with an introduction to the mathematical theory and the software interfaces needed to realize \ac{MPC}. 
The goal of this work is to enable a tricycle kinematic vehicle to perform optimal detours around obstacles while tracking a predefined trajectory and considering motion constraints in a warehouse environment.
\par The obstacle avoidance formulation is capable of handling a predefined number of objects approximated by geometric constraints, introduced in two Optimal Control Problems (OCP).
\ac{MPC} is considered here due to its inherent ability to deal with nonlinear analytic models, while explicitly respecting constraints. Motivated to demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the control scheme, the implementation in acados \cite{verschueren_acados_2020} is validated in simulation and at the warehouse aboard a test vehicle.
