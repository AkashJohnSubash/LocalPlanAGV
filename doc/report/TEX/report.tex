  parskip=half, % This is some extra vertical space between paragraphs, the suggestion is 2cm which is ugly, so we use what the script gives us
  % You can also set it to full for even more space. But there is a bad tex style decision: Parskip also changes the spacing between list items such as
  % enumerate and itemize. So we include the enum item package and set itemsep=.5em, of course you can change this
  BCOR=10mm, % BCOR is a binding correction

  % If you'd rather have a one-sided thesis, add `Oneside' to the document class
  % Oneside,
  % Ngerman is needed for hyphenation if the thesis contains parts written in German, switch order with English if you write mainly in English.
  % Remember to change the order in the babel package (below) as well.
  % Last language is the preferred one.
